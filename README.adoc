== Status of This Document
This document is normative.

== Scope
PLAYBOOK defines executable plans derived from META transformations.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, PLAYBOOKs are consequences of META,
not independent sources of authority.

== Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are to be interpreted
as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

== Role in the System
PLAYBOOK specifies *how* an allowed action is carried out, not *whether*
it is allowed.

PLAYBOOKs:
- MUST NOT introduce new authority
- MUST NOT override META axioms
- MUST operate within AGENTIC gating decisions
- MUST produce actions compatible with NEUROSYM semantics

== Derivation Rules
By default, a PLAYBOOK MUST be deterministically derivable from:
- META rules
- validated user intent
- current STATE context

A PLAYBOOK MAY declare itself non-derived only if:
- META explicitly permits this class, and
- the PLAYBOOK declares its authority source.

== Execution Constraints
PLAYBOOK execution:
- MUST occur after META validation and AGENTIC gating
- MUST occur before ECOSYSTEM integrity checks
- MUST NOT directly update STATE

== Failure Modes
If PLAYBOOK execution fails:
- The system MUST rollback or branch
- STATE MUST NOT be committed
- The failure MUST be recorded in the journal

== Conformance
An implementation is PLAYBOOK-conformant if:
- All PLAYBOOKs are either derived or explicitly permitted
- No PLAYBOOK bypasses META or AGENTIC
- Execution ordering is preserved
